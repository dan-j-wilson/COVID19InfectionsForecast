methods_long: "We estimate an econometric county panel data model based on the\
  \ standard SIR model. \
  \ The econometric model relates the change in log active (new) infections\
  \ between now and some\
  \ future horizon to the current transmission rate and the susceptible share\
  \ of the population. \
  \ The current transmission rate is assumed to be a function of individuals’\
  \ mobility behavior\
  \ and weather (temperature and precipitation). County level mobility is\
  \ measured using the Mobility and Engagement Index (MEI) constructed by\
  \ the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas from mobile device geolocation data\
  \ provided by Safegraph. County level weather data comes from weather\
  \ station readings on daily-high temperatures and precipitation from the\
  \ National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), following the\
  \ methodology in Wilson (2019). For diseases that convey long-lasting\
  \ immunity to those who have recovered from infection,\
  \ the susceptible share is simply one minus the share of the local population\
  \ that have previously been infected. We assume this share in a given county\
  \ is proportional to cumulative confirmed cases to date as a share of the\
  \ county’s population. This proportionality also implies that the change in\
  \ log active infections can be proxied by the change in log active cases.\
  \ Aside from mobility, weather, and accumulated natural immunity, there are two other \
  \ important elements of the econometric model. The first is lagged infection growth, \
  \ allowing for the possibility that lagged infection growth is predictive of subsequent \
  \ infection growth. The second additional element is county-specific intercepts\
  \ (fixed effects), which allow each county to have a different mean level of\
  \ infection growth, independent of the other elements of the model."
